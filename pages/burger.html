        <li>1 pound (450 grams) ground beef (preferably 80% lean)</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>Sliced tomatoes</li>
        <li>Sliced onions</li>
        <li>Pickles (optional)</li>
        <li>Cheese slices (usually American, Cheddar, or your choice)</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>Mustard</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to season the beef patties</li>
        <li>Butter or oil for toasting buns (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by gathering all the necessary ingredients and utensils.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill or stove top skillet to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>While the grill or skillet is heating up, divide the ground beef into equal portions to form your burger patties.
            Season each patty with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li>If you prefer, you can shape the patties into a round shape or use a burger press for consistency.</li>
        <li>Place the burger patties on the grill or skillet and cook for about 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare, or adjust
            the cooking time to your desired level of doneness.</li>
        <li>While the patties are cooking, you can optionally toast the burger buns on the grill or in a toaster until they are
            lightly browned.</li>
        <li>When the burgers are almost done, add a slice of cheese to each patty and allow it to melt slightly by covering the
            grill or skillet with a lid.</li>
        <li>Remove the burger patties from the heat and let them rest for a minute while you prepare the toppings.</li>
        <li>Assemble your burgers by placing a lettuce leaf on the bottom half of each bun, followed by a burger patty with
            melted cheese, tomato slices, and onion rings.</li>
        <li>Add any additional condiments of your choice, such as ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise.</li>
        <li>Finish by placing the top half of the burger bun on the assembled ingredients.</li>
        <li>Insert a toothpick or skewer through the center to hold the burger together, if desired.</li>
        <li>Your delicious homemade burger is now ready to serve!</li>
    </ol>
