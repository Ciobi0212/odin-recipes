        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced pepperoni</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes <strong>(optional, for a bit of heat)</strong></li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish <strong>(optional)</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on your pizza crust package or recipe (usually around 450°F or 232°C).</li>
        <li>Roll out your pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness. If you're using store-bought dough, follow the package instructions for rolling it out.</li>
        <li>Place the rolled-out dough onto a pizza stone or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, covering the entire pizza.</li>
        <li>Arrange the sliced pepperoni evenly on top of the cheese.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle dried oregano, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes (if using) over the pepperoni for added flavor.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated oven and bake according to your crust's instructions, typically for about 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven using oven mitts or a pizza peel.</li>
        <li>Let the pizza cool for a minute or two, then slice it into wedges.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy your homemade pepperoni pizza!</li>
    </ol>
